/**
   \headerfile guarded.hpp <libguarded/guarded.hpp>

   This templated class wraps an object and allows only one thread at a
   time to access the protected object.

   This class will use std::mutex for the internal locking mechanism by
   default. Other classes which are useful for the mutex type are
   std::recursive_mutex, std::timed_mutex, and
   std::recursive_timed_mutex.

   The handle returned by the various lock methods is moveable but not
   copyable.
