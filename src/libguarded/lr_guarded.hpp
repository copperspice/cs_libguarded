/**
   \headerfile lr_guarded.hpp <libguarded/lr_guarded.hpp>

   This templated class wraps an object and allows only one thread at
   a time to modify the protected object.

   This class will use std::mutex for the internal locking mechanism
   by default. Other classes which are useful for the mutex type are
   std::recursive_mutex, std::timed_mutex, and
   std::recursive_timed_mutex.

   The handle returned by the various lock methods is moveable and
   copyable.

   Internally this class operates by maintaining two copies of the
   data and applying the same modifications to each copy in
   turn. Therefore the lr_guarded object will consume twice as much
   memory as one T plus a small amount of overhead.

 The T class must be copy constructible and copy assignable.

     exactly one argument of type T&. The functor will be called
     twice, once for each copy of the data. It must make the same
     modification for both invocations.

     If the first invocation of the functor throws an exception, the
     modification will be rolled back by copying from the unchanged
     copy. If the second invocation throws, the modification will be
     completed by copying from the changed copy. In either case if the
     copy constructor throws, the data is left in an indeterminate
     state.
